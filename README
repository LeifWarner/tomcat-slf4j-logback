This projects main and only goal is to allow the following:
 * redirect all org.apache.commons.logging (repackaged to
   org.apache.juli.logging) calls to org.slf4j (repackaged to
   org.apache.juli.logging) - i.e. handle internal tomcat logging
   with logback
 * make possible using logback-access with logback-access.xml config
 * make possible to use independent configuration of slf4j+logback from all web
   applications
